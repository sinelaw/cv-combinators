Functional Combinators for Computer Vision

This library is intended to wrap CV primitives in a pure functional API. 
Currently the idea is to use HOpenCV (OpenCV bindings for Haskell) as the backend.

Bottom Line:
------------

camera :: PIO () (Ptr CxCore.IplImage)

resizer :: PIO (Ptr CxCore.IplImage) (Ptr CxCore.IplImage)

test1 :: PIO () (Ptr CxCore.IplImage)
test1 = resizer . camera 


TODO:
-----

* Write "splitter" and "joiner" processor primitives

* Allow viewing the processor graph

* Use MaybeT and processors that output Maybes to implement a "FRP" (?) framework:
  - continuously re-run the processing loop, which will terminate an iteration whenever one process returns Nothing
  - somehow run each processor only once, even if graph was split (and even re-joined)
